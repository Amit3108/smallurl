# How to contribute to the repo

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

1. Make sure to comment on an existing issue or create an issue. ( Creating an issue for discussion before submitting a PR would be better )
2. Once assigned to you, start working and create a PR. (assignment of issues will be on FCFS basis)
3. The PR will be reviewed and merged by the maintainer.
